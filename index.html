                    Melbourne has been ranked the Worldâ€™s Most Liveable City for the seventh consecutive year as of
                    2017, achieving a total score of 97.5: 95 for stability, 95.1 for culture and environment and a
                    perfect 100
                    for healthcare, education and infrastructure.Despite such an amazing feat, this begs the question of
                    whether such an achievement influences the property market in any way. Does the rank take into
                    consideration the
                    affordability of properties in this city, or does it cause an increase in the property prices?

                        Saturday remains the most popular day to sell property. While this is a blessing for sellers,
                        this often means there is much more competition for buyers. Buyers often
                        feel there are greater options on the market over the weekend, in particular on Saturdays, so
                        they tend to hold off committing to a sale on a weekday.

                        <br>
                        The worst months to sell property would be the period between December and February as most
                        potential buyers are wrapped up in holiday plans and travel or they are
                        focusing on purchasing gifts as opposed to saving for a downpayment.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The drastic decrease in properties sold between August 2017 and November 2017 can be attributed
                        to the surge in property prices.
